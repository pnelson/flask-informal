Flask-Informal
==============

Wow, was I trying too hard with the project name or what?

Anyway, this project was written and abandoned in 2011. Also, security is
dangerous stuff. Use something well known instead. I only kept it around because
I spent a lot of time on it as I learned about metaclasses and descriptors.

Obviously it could use a lot of refactoring as there is a lot of duplicate code
between classes. The RegEx class is a disaster as it can't be deepcopied or
pickled and I never could figure out how to get that working.

Anyway, here it is. I'm open for some constructive criticism.
